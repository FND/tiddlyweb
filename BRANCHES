Now that the 1.0.0 version of TiddlyWeb has been released,
development will continue on two branches:

1.0.x:  This is current stable branch, on which only bug fixes 
        will be done. Releases to PyPI will happen from here.

master: This is the current development branch, which will include
        features, possible backwards compatibility issues, and
        advancement. Versions from this branch will be numbered 1.1.x
        and will not be released to PyPI.

When 1.1.x matures, it will become a stable branch named 1.2.x.
